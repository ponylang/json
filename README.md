# JSON

A JSON library for [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/)

## Status

JSON is an beta-level package.

JSON was extracted from the standard library as part of [RFC #78](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/main/text/0078-remove-json-package-from-stdlib.md). We expect that the API will evolve over time.

* `corral fetch` to fetch your dependencies
